In this example, the HTML code creates a div element with the class neon-effect. The CSS code defines the styles for the element, including the font size, color, padding, and border radius. The transition property creates a smooth animation when the user hovers over the element. The box-shadow property creates the neon glow effect.

When the user hovers over the element, the :hover pseudo-class is applied, which changes the box-shadow property to create a more intense neon effect.

Note that this is just one example of a neon hover effect, and there are many other ways to create this type of effect using HTML, and CSS.
